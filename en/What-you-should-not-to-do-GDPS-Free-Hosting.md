### What you should not do in GDPS Free Hosting. (GDPSFH)

1. Do not leave the server if you have a GDPS Created, otherwise your GDPS will be deleted and you won't be able to create another GDPS.
2. Don't spam to get Level 1 in order to create a GDPS, you will just get warned/muted and it will take even longer to create your GDPS. Earn your first level by talking normally.
3. Don't ask for help in the main chat, there is this site which contains FAQ. You can ask for help in #community-help.
4. Do not try and bypass the punishment you received! If you broke the rules you get a warning, after getting a specfic amount of warnings you will get banned or muted.
5. Do not abuse the space your GDPS Server has, such as adding useless large files. This will be seen as database clogging or a DDoS.
6. Do not promote your GDPS by breaking the rules. Do it in advertising channels that are made for it.

## What is recommended to do in GDPS Free Hosting (GDPS FH)

1. Before talking, know the Server Rules, [Discord Terms of Service] (https://discord.com/tos), and also red through #read-me in the server which sums a few things up. So you won't be confused later.
2. Look at the FAQ or search the internet for information before asking someone for help.
3. Use the Discord Bots the Hosting offers you to run your Private Server, the GDPS Bot will DM you them after you created your Private Server. Using other bots (not verified by our host) is possible to scam you.

Enjoy your stay!
